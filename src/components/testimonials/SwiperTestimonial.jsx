      "You can rely on Nivid all the time to get things done. He always keeps the zeal to learn the unknowns and dig deeper into incidents. He is hard working, always gives feedback, great listener. One thing that amazes me every time about Nivid is his level of patience, attitude and cool he keeps at times under extreme pressure.",
