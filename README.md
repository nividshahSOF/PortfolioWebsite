# Welcome to Nivid Shah's Portfolio Website 🚀

Hey there, curious coder or accidental visitor!  
You’ve just opened the source code for my portfolio website.  
Prepare yourself for a journey through my projects, skills, and possibly a few bugs I forgot to fix.

## What’s Inside?

- **Projects:** Where I show off and hope you’re impressed.
- **Skills:** Endorsed by me, myself, and I.
- **Contact:** Because even introverts need networking.

## How to Run This Thing

1. Clone the repo (bonus points for using GitHub Copilot).
2. Run `npm install` (don’t worry, it’s safe).
3. Run `npm start` and watch the magic happen at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Why This Exists

Because every developer needs a portfolio, and every portfolio needs a README.  
Also, recruiters love clicking shiny links.

## Pro Tips

- If you find a typo, it’s a feature.
- If you find a bug, it’s an opportunity for collaboration.
- If you’re here to steal my code, at least star the repo first.
